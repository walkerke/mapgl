### Using Mapbox GL JS

Your gateway to Mapbox GL JS v3 in R is the `mapboxgl()` function. Run the function with no arguments to get an interactive globe using Mapbox's Standard style:

```{r}
library(mapgl)

mapboxgl()
```

To use Mapbox maps, you will need a [Mapbox access token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/). If you are a user of the [mapboxapi](https://walker-data.com/mapboxapi) package and have installed your Mapbox access token, `mapboxgl()` will pick up your token for you. If you are new to my R packages, you'll want to get a token from your Mapbox account, run `usethis::edit_r_environ()`, and set the environment variable `MAPBOX_PUBLIC_TOKEN="your_token_here"`. It's important for you to know that Mapbox GL JS is a commercial product that charges you for map views; however, it does have a generous free tier.

Mapbox's default styles are accessible with the `mapbox_style()` function, and can be passed to the `style` parameter to change the style of your map. Mapbox GL JS also supports modifying map projections; here we use `projection = "winkelTripel"` for the Winkel Tripel global projection.

```{r}
mapboxgl(
  style = mapbox_style("satellite"),
  projection = "winkelTripel")
```

To get a more local view in your map, you can use the `center`, `zoom`, `pitch`, and `bearing` arguments. In the example shown below, these arguments are incorporated into a "fly to" animation. **mapgl** supports several of these animated transitions. In Mapbox GL JS v3, the new Standard style includes custom-rendered buildings around the world, such as the American Airlines Center in Dallas.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mapboxgl(
  center = c(-97.6, 25.4)
) |> 
  fly_to(
    center = c(-96.810481, 32.790869),
    zoom = 18.4,
    pitch = 75,
    bearing = 136.8
  )
```

### Using Maplibre GL JS

Maplibre GL JS, a fork of the more permissively-licensed Mapbox GL JS 1.0, is also available to R users in **mapgl**. The core function to initialize a MapLibre map is `maplibre()`. The default tiles in `maplibre()` are CARTO's Voyager tiles, which are usable without an API key.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(mapgl)

maplibre()
```

[MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/) tiles are also available via the `maptiler_style()` function. These styles work quite well with MapLibre, but do require an API key; set the environment variable `MAPTILER_API_KEY` in your .Renviron file to store your key. The example below uses the Bright MapTiler style, and adds a fullscreen control and a navigation control to the map.

These controls and styles are available with `mapboxgl()` as well; **mapgl** aims to provide a consistent API to work with either Mapbox or MapLibre.

```{r}
maplibre(
  style = maptiler_style("bright"),
  center = c(-43.23412, -22.91370),
  zoom = 14
) |> 
  add_fullscreen_control(position = "top-left") |> 
  add_navigation_control()
```

### Comparing map views

**mapgl** includes a function `compare()` that allows users to create synced swipe maps that can compare two styles. This function works for either Mapbox or MapLibre maps, though the MapLibre implementation is not quite as full-featured.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
m1 <- mapboxgl()
m2 <- mapboxgl(mapbox_style("satellite-streets"))

compare(m1, m2)
```

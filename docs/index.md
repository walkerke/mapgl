# mapgl

The **mapgl** R package makes the latest versions of [Mapbox GL
JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) and [MapLibre GL
JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/) available to R users. The
package interface is designed to make the powerful capabilities of both
libraries available in R mapping projects, but also feel similar to
users coming from other R mapping packages.

Install from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("mapgl")
```

Or, install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("walkerke/mapgl")
```
